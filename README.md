# Project Proposal 

## 1.Vision and Goals Of The Project:
The goal of this project is to build an operator for a cloud native application for developers to deploy microservices on Kubernetes. 

The high level definition of this project is to: 
* Ease the deployment of an application in Kubernetes.
* Extending Kubernetes and it’s CLI’s ability to understand the function, performance and potential of this new resource  


## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:
The personas we are targeting is an infrastructure operator for entrepreneurs to deploy any applications without knowledge of the dependencies of the application.


## 3. Scope and Features Of The Project:
The scope of the project is to develop an operator (CRD + controller) for a sample application.

Features A:
* Automatically set up running dependencies for sample applications  
* Feedback for custom resource usage 

Feature B:
* Design CRD (which includes the schema)
* Design and implement the CDR controller
* Testing and the controller and refine it
